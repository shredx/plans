## Why ShredX :beginner:

ShredX is unique because it focuses on the following:

- Express your interest to the people (like REDIS, React, Js, GoLang, Erlang)
- Other people with the same interest can join you
- Find a place & collaborate together
- Small number of people (limited to 5)
- Build small POCs, Small Basic version of complex apps Like facebook, youtube, blog, editor etc
- Showcase (push) it to ShredX organisation
- Extra perks
  - Lean more about GitHub by collaboration like branches, conflicts, pull requests, rebase, writing good commits
  - Code reviews of projects & unit tests <sup>1</sup>
  - CI/CD <sup>2</sup>

## Get Started :vertical_traffic_light:

- Open an issue with any topic/technology from your bucket list
  - Please follow the **issue_template**<sup>3</sup> and go through this [issue](https://github.com/shredx/plans/issues/2) before writing one
- Alternatively you can vote for other open issues as well
- Get together with people who share same interest

### Gotchas :warning:

- Say an issue with REDIS got 10 votes then,

  - Two Teams containing 5 members each will be formed
  - Let the names be like Team A & Team B
  - We can have either 2 sessions, one with each team on different days
  - Run in parallel with both the teams in the same day

- Your topic did not grab any atention
  - Well good idea is to wait till it manage to get people
  - If it's more than 20 days, we will merge it with other such topics

### About the Name :performing_arts:

**X** means it can be anything related to technology. Shred means tiny, everything revolves around this word.

- Your project should be tiny so as to complete it in weekends
- Weekends are itself very tiny
- Team size is also very tiny (mininum 2 to maximun of 5)
